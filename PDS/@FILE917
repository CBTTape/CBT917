//***FILE 917 is from George DeLuca and contains SELECTIT, which    *   FILE 917
//*           is an EXTREMELY powerful file copying and file        *   FILE 917
//*           manipulation program.  Included is its extensive      *   FILE 917
//*           documentation in both Word and PDF format (over 100   *   FILE 917
//*           pages).  Actually, this program was constructed to be *   FILE 917
//*           very straightforward and simple to use.  There are    *   FILE 917
//*           just a lot of capabilities, including concatenation   *   FILE 917
//*           of input files with unlike formats, and also output   *   FILE 917
//*           files with different formats than the input files.    *   FILE 917
//*           This program is used extensively in production runs   *   FILE 917
//*           at the site where it was developed.                   *   FILE 917
